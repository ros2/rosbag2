# Rosbag2 Playback Time Handling

## Context

This design does not consider recording, it only handles playback, which has a more complex interaction with time.

Terms:
* "ROS Time" - the time expressed on a `/clock` topic
* "ROS Time Source" - the entity that publishes to `/clock`
For more context on time in ROS 2 see http://design.ros2.org/articles/clock_and_time.html#ros-time

## Goal

We need Rosbag2 playback to do more than just playing back in real time according to the system clock.
For playback we want to support the following "time-control" features:
* Pause and resume time
  * When time is resumed, rosbag2 will play the next message in sequence after the last one it published
  * There is an alternate concept of "pause and resume" that means "suppress recording/publishing while time continues, such that messages are skipped" - I use "pause and resume" in this document in the sense of "stopping and starting the flow of time". An alternative design handles that other feature, which may be more appropriately named something else such as "suppress", or "mute" for an analogy with an audio playback.
* Set a (forward) rate of playback - either faster or slower than real time
  * This is already implemented as of this writing, but this design proposes a change in the implementation
* Jump back or forward to an arbitrary point in time
  * This is called "jump" in the time interface, but will likely be exposed in the player interface as "seek"
* Play next message in pause mode
  * This is new functionality allowing to playback next message immediately without delay when 
    in pause. This is might be useful for debug purposes to iterate step by step in pause by 
    pressing appropriate keyboard key. Also could be used for deterministic data driven replay by 
    third-party applications.    

These are the time situations to handle:
1. Steady Time - Rosbag2 keeps time internally with reference to a monotonic system clock, and neither publishes or subscribes to `/clock`
  * This is the default behavior
2. Rosbag2 acts as ROS Time Source by publishing to the `/clock` topic (a simple extension of case 1)
  * Chosen by `--clock` option to `ros2 bag play`
3. Rosbag2 is driven by an external ROS Time Source - most commonly the Gazebo simulator
  * In this case, Rosbag2 cannot use "time-control" features presented above, since it is a passive consumer of time
  * Chosen by `--use-sim-time` argument to `ros2 bag play`

NOTE: The user is responsible for ensuring that there is only one publisher on `/clock` - Rosbag2 will not try to de-conflict multiple ROS Time Sources, but it will print a warning if more than one publisher is detected.

## Notes on current implementation (as of writing this design)

`rosbag2_transport::Player` currently uses `std::chrono::system_clock` to query time, and `std::this_thread::sleep_until` to wait between publishing messages, with explicit handling of playback rate.

## Proposal

Pass a `PlayerClock` instance to `rosbag2_transport::Player`
* Use `PlayerClock::now` to query starting time
* Use `PlayerClock::sleep_until` between messages
  * `rclcpp::Clock` does not yet implement `sleep_until` - as noted in https://github.com/ros2/rcl/issues/898
  * If we are not able to contribute this feature into `rclcpp` in time for the Galactic API freeze - it may need to temporarily go into a rosbag2-based subclass for the Galactic release.

The following pseudocode suggests the high level function and API (but does not set it in stone)

```
// A time point value without a reference time
type TimePointValue;

// A time interval
type Duration;

/*
  Used to control the timing of bag playback.
  This clock should be used to query times and sleep between message playing,
  so that the complexity involved around time control and time sources is encapsulated in this one place.
  Internally, it may own an rclcpp::Clock, but does not override the class in order to implement a slightly different API.
*/
class PlayerClock
{
  /*
    Provide the current time according to the clock's internal model.
    if use_sim_time: provides current ROS Time (with optional extrapolation - see "Clock Rate and Time Extrapolation" section)
    if !use_sim_time: calculates current "Player Time" based on starting time, playback rate, pause state.
      this means that /clock time will match with the recorded messages time, as if we are fully reliving the recorded session
   */
  TimePointValue now();

  /*
    Sleep (non-busy wait) the current thread until the provided time is reached - according to this Clock
    If time is paused, the requested time may never be reached: `real_time_timeout` uses the internal steady clock to return false if the timeout elapses
    If jump() is called, return false, allowing the caller to handle the new time
    Return true when the time is reached

### Clock Rate and Time Extrapolation

This section is only relevant for Case 3 (subscribing to an external ROS Time Source), and does not apply to other cases.

Common `/clock` publish rates are 10-100Hz - which is considerably slower than, for example, an IMU which may commonly publish at 200Hz or faster.
According to the [ROS Time Source Design](http://design.ros2.org/articles/clock_and_time.html#ros-time-source), "calls to the ROS time abstraction will return the latest time received from the `/clock` topic."
This means that faster topics will have a playback resolution only as fine as the `/clock` rate, as illustrated below.

```
# dots are arbitrary time tick, letters are when a message is published
# M is topic Message, C is /clock message

# original system
M..M..M..M..M..M..M..M..M..M..M..
C.......C........C........C......

# playback on use_sim_time with default behavior - when a new time sample is received a burst of backed up messages will be played
M.......MM.......MMM......MMM....
C.......C........C........C......
```

The section ["No Advanced Estimating Clock By Default"](http://design.ros2.org/articles/clock_and_time.html#no-advanced-estimating-clock-by-default) of the "Clock and Time" design lays out that more advanced behavior is possible, though (direct quote) "these techniques will require making assumptions about the future behavior of the time abstraction. And in the case that playback or simulation is instantaneously paused, it will break any of these assumptions."
To paraphrase: we can't possibly know what the next `/clock` message will be or if it will arrive at all; it could be a larger value interval (increased rate), smaller time interval (decreased rate), never arrive (paused), or a jump to a totally unrelated time.

While the above is technically true, I propose that we implement a simple extrapolation anyways for the case of subscribing to an external ROS Time Source:
* Store internally the last N time samples (noting the rate that samples are received)
* When `now()` is called, determine the rate from the stored time samples and extrapolate based on time
* Put a watchdog on the clock to notice if new messages are not received in the expected period
  * Deadline QoS on the `/clock` publisher is preferred for this, but we may not be able to enforce this for all ROS Time Sources
  * Immediately "pause time" when a missing sample is noticed

Error cases:
  * ROS Time Source increases rate-of-time: playback may be slightly behind, and catches up by the next sample
  * ROS Time Source decreases rate-of-time: playback may be slightly ahead based on extrapolated messages being published early, and will wait until the newly correct time to publish next messages. It will not re-publish any already-published message.
  * ROS Time Source is instantaneously paused: Rosbag2 will play back "future" messages for no longer than one clock-sample period, stopping once the pause is noticed

The error in at all cases is _at most_ the amount of time that is represented by one clock sample.
This design deems that error acceptable for most use cases, and the benefit large for high-frequency topic playback.
To let the user make this decision, it is an optionally enabled behavior via `--extrapolate-ros-time`, which only has an effect when `--use-sim-time` is provided.
Note: The faster the `/clock` rate, the smaller the possible error both with and without extrapolation.

### Pause and Resume Time

No special allowance needs to be made in the `Player` - time will still be provided, but it will not move forward, so the next message will not be published until time is resumed.

NOTE: this is different than "suppress/mute" where time continues but publishing stops - that feature is handled outside of time-control.

### Setting the Rate

No special allowance needs to be made in the `Player` - time will be provided at a different rate, and `sleep_until` will handle this.

### Time Jumps

The `Player` must register a `JumpHandler` with the `Clock` - so that when a jump occurs, the current message playback queue can be invalidated and re-enqueued according to the new starting time.

## Time Synchronization and Conversion

When implementing this time control, there are two separate time streams to consider:
1. "ROS time": this is the time that is related to the messages in the bag - this time may speed up, slow down, pause, or jump based on rosbag playback controls (or external Time Sources)
2. "Steady time": this time always moves forward, and always moves at the same rate; it is the real time that the user watching a playback experiences

To implement `now() -> ROSTime` and `sleep_until(ROSTime until)`, we need to perform arbitrary conversion between "ROS Time" and "Steady Time".

We use the following diagrams to visualize the derivation for these conversion equations.
Steady Time is marked as timeline `S`, and ROS Time as timeline `R`.
Any `R_n` and `S_n` are matched time points, they coincide with each other: at Steady Time `S_n`, `now()` will return `R_n`.
Likewise, when `sleep_until(R_n)` is called, the `PlayerClock` which uses steady time for sleeping, will sleep until `S_n`.

In this diagram you can see `rate` changes, `pause`, and `jump`, with arrows showing matched points.
The bag we are playing starts at R0 and goes on forward in time (we do not show the end of the bag).
The user is performing actions in `S`, the timeline that they experience.

The lines and numbered references indicate "events" where a time control operation has been performed, such as changing the rate, pausing, or jumping.

Events in the first timeline "Rate Change":
1. At `S_0`: start playback at rate `0.5`
1. At `S_1`: change rate to `2.0`
1. At `S_2`: change rate to `1.0`

Events in the second timeline "Pause / Jump":
1. At `S_0`: start playback at regular speed
1. At `S_1`: call `pause`
1. At `S_2`: call `resume`
1. At `S_3`: call `jump` to `R_4`
  * We could also jump backwards on the ROS Timeline just as simply (however that diagram has crossing lines)

![diagram showing two timelines with rate change pause and jump](time_control_timelines.png "Timelines")

In between the time control events, there are arbitrary points `R_x / S_x`, `R_y / S_y`, and `R_z / S_z` that we need to convert between.
We do that using the following equations:

![equations for converting letter-subscripted time points](time_control_intermediate_equations.png "Intermediate Equations")

The above equations are clearly of a general form, as follows

![final equations for converting time points](time_control_final_equations.png "General Equation")


Based on this, the implementation will need to take a "snapshot" of `R_ref` and `S_ref` whenever a time control operation is performed, so that future conversions can be accurately calculated.

## Other notable results

### Synchronizing rosbag2 playback

As a consequence of this design, it is possible to synchronize the playback of multiple rosbags, by setting one to publish with `--clock`, and the others to listen with `--use-sim-time`. This feature is useful if for example bags were recorded for different topic selections, in the same time range.

## Implementation Staging

This should not be implemented monolithically. Implementation should focus on small incremental PRs with solid testing that are easy to review.
This is a proposed order of operations.

* Create a mostly-unimplemented `PlayerClock` class, and have `Player` use it to maintain current functionality. This accomplishes the entire API change without taking very much implementation or review.
* Move playback rate handling out of `Player` to be handled by `PlayerClock`
* Implement `/clock` publisher
* Implement pause/resume to the `PlayerClock`
* Implement time jump to the `PlayerClock` (and handlers to the `Player`)
* Implement play_next to the `PlayerClock`
* Expose rate, pause/resume, and time jump as Services to enable CLI/keyboard/GUI controls
* Implement `use_sim_time` (`/clock` subscription) - without extrapolation
* Implement sim time extrapolation

# We have to include a number of patches to the rosbag
# 1. rosbag1_encryption_patch includes https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/pull/1499, without it, pluginlib won't link
# 2. rosbag1_for_ros2_patch patches the pluginlib usage:
#    Missing boost/bind include
#    Using pluginlib with boost results in compile errors on some systems, so we need to switch to pluginlib without boost
# 3. rosbag1_ament_patch.diff patches the catkin package to ament and renames it
#    Patching to ament is necessary as otherwise colcon needs to build a catkin package together with an ament package, which is impossible
#    Renaming the package is necessary on some systems to not confuse the linker
#
# Note that we need to build with CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED. This prohibits cmake from
# declaring any paths as "internal" (flagged with -isystem instead of -I) which can result in this
# vendor package building against the wrong pluginlib, because the paths get switched.
# Symptoms of wrong paths: The build of the rosbag for ROS 1 plugins fails with missing symbols
# like ros::package::getPlugins(...) when linking the vendor package

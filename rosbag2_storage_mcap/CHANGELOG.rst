0.1.0 (2022-03-24)
------------------
* [1.0.0] Use Summary section for get_metadata() and seek(), implement remaining methods (`#17 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/17>`_)
* feat: add play impl (`#16 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/16>`_)
* chore: refine package.xml (`#15 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/15>`_)
* Don't throw when READ_WRITE mode is used; add .mcap file extension to recorded files (`#14 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/14>`_)
  I may be missing something, but from a cursory glance at [this code](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/342d8ed3c1c4ae0411a4a92b60e79a728b8974b8/rosbag2_storage/src/rosbag2_storage/impl/storage_factory_impl.hpp#L108-L135), it appears that the `APPEND` mode is never used. This means we need to support `READ_WRITE`.
  This also adds a `.mcap` extension to recorded file names.
* Add dynamic message definition lookup (`#13 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/13>`_)
  Currently, an exception will be thrown if lookup fails.
* Switch C++ formatter to clang-format (`#12 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/12>`_)
  Remove uncrustify linter in favor of clang-format, which is easier to configure for use in VS Code format-on-save.

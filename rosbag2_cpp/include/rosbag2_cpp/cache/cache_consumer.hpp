/**
* This class is responsible for consuming the cache using provided fuction.
* It can work with any callback conforming to the consume_callback_function_t
* signature, e.g. a storage write function. Consuming and thus the callback are
* called in a separate thread.
*
* Since the consuming callback likely involves disk operations, the main motivation
* for design is to make sure that consumer is busy anytime there is any work.
* This is realized through conditional variable and greedy buffer switching.
*
* The consumer uses MessageCache and waits for consumer buffer to be ready. This
* will happen as soon as that there are any messages put into producer buffer -
* a switch of buffer pointers will result in these messages being available for
* consumption. The consumer then proceeds to process the entire buffer in one go.
* While this is ongoing, the producer buffer is being filled with new messages.
*
* For SQLite implementation of storage, consumer callback will write consumer buffer
* in each loop iteration as a separate transaction. This results in a balancing
* mechanism for high-performance cases, where transaction size can be increased
* dynamically as previous, smaller transactions introduce delays in loop iteration.
